Clusterio Player Auth Plugin
============================

Plugin authenticating logged in players to the web interface.
Authentication is achieved by a simple challenge response mechanism
where players have to log into one of the Factorio server in the cluster
and open a dialog that presents a code, this code is input into the
login form on the web interface which gives back a second code.  Once
the player enters the second code into the dialog in-game the web
interface is authenticated.
