## Version 2.0.0

### Major Features

- Replaced Hotpatch with save patching.
  Removed the Hotpatch scenario and the depency on it for getting code into the game.
  Added a save patcher than runs before starting up Factorio that patches in lua modules based on the event_loader lib into the savegame.
  Regular freeplay games can now be used with Clusterio and will be compatible without having to convert them to Hotpatch.
- Daemonized hosts.
  Hosts now have the ability to run multiple Factorio instances, starting and stopping them individually.
  To manage this the local command line interface has been replaced with a remote interface on the controller that can be accessed through the clusterioctl cli tool.
- Rewritten the communication between hosts and the controller from scratch.
  The new system is based on a WebSocket connection between the hosts and the controller and provides efficient validated bi-directonal communication.
- Rewritten the plugin system from scratch.
  Plugins now inherit from a base class and use the same WebSocket connection Clusterio uses to communicate.
- New configuration system with support for initializing configs when needed, modifying config entries using built-in commands, and updating instance configuration remotely.
- Packaged and uploaded to npm again, greatly simplifying distribution and installation of both Clusterio and plugins.
- Added centralized logging for the cluster.
  All logs from both Clusterio and Factorio is stored in a shared log which can be inspected and queried.
- Added remote save management with the ability to list, create, rename, copy, upload, download, transfer, delete and load saves for instances.

### Features

- Added export of pollution statitics.
- Reconnection logic that esures no data is dropped talking to the controller provided the session can be resumed.

- Added Factorio server CPU and memory usage statistic.
- Added Factorio autosave size statistic.
- Added support for extracting locale and item icons from Factorio and mods.

  Previously this was handled by the playerManager plugin.
- Added stripping of long paths in the Factorio server log.
- Added option to configure maximum number of commands to send in parallel.
- Added option to auto start instances on host startup.
- Added metric mapping of host and instance ids to their names, allowing them to be displayed by name in queries that join with the mapping.
- Added option to configure timeout for exported Prometheus metrics.
- Added option to set address to bind HTTP(S) port to.
- Added an overview of the installed plugins to the web interface.

  On Windows hard links are used instead due to the privileges requirements of symlinks.
