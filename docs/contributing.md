## Workflow

While we don't require you to follow this workflow, it makes things much simpler for both you and us if you choose to do so.
Especially when it comes to making the commit history reflect what happened and not be a giant ball of mess.
GitHub's git workflow is less than ideal for dealing with small feature-branches so you might see things being done here a little diffrent than the usual.

It is recommended that you use the command line git version for doing the operations described here.
GUI wrappers tend to have different ideas of what is what and you might find it difficult to make it do the things described here.
For doing the actual commits though, your faviorit git GUI should work just fine.

If you pressed the fork button on GitHub and used `git clone` _on your own fork_ you can skip to the next paragraph.
Otherwise you will have to click the fork button and clone your fork.
If you already cloned the main GitHub repository you can change your clone to point at your own fork using the `git remote` command, but it's probably easier to delete your local clone and clone it again.

To keep your local repository up to to date with the main repository add the main repository as a remote.

    git remote add upstream https://github.com/clusterio/factorioClusterio

After this running `git fetch upstream` will get the updated branches from the main repository.
Do not run `git pull upstream` it will mess thing up!


### Setting up the Development Environment

The project is organized into several packages that are all managed through Lerna.
In order to get the development environment up and running you will need to run the following commands:

    npm install
    npx lerna bootstrap

This installs dependencies needed by tests and links the packages up so they work from the git work tree.


### Starting a Feature Branch

Development is done exclusively in feature branches.
This means the first thing to do before starting any development at all is to make a new branch starting from the master or 1.2.x branch of the main repository.
To do this check out that branch from the main repository (substitute master for 1.2.x if you're working on that branch).

    git fetch upstream
    git checkout upstream/master

This will give a warning about detached HEAD which means you did it correctly.
Now you can make a feature branch based on this with.

    git checkout -b my-feature-branch

The name of the branch is not important, as long as it's not a name you've used before.
But it's nice to have its name be somewhat descriptive of what it implements.


### Checking your code for errors

There's automated tests and linting setup for the project.
Please do add tests for any code you add and run both:

    npm run test
    npm run lint

To check that your changes pass the integration tests as well as the ESLint rules set up for the project.


### Submitting a Pull Request

Once you've commited changes to your feature branch that you want to have included into the main repository push it to you fork with

    git push origin my-feature-branch

and make a pull request through the GitHub web interface.
You can also pass the `--set-upstream` (or `-u`) flag to make `git push` do the same thing for this branch.
After your feature branch have been merged you should consider it final.
If there are more changes you want to have merged or mistakes you need to fix you must start a new feature branch and submit a new pull request.


### Editing your Feature Branch

Until your feature branch is merged you can edit it as you see fit by using the rebase tool.
If your feature branch has been merged however it's final and you will have to start a new feature branch and submit that in a new pull request.
The base usage of rebase assuming you are checked out on your feature branch is the following command (substitute master with 1.2.x if your feature branch is based on that)

    git rebase -i upstream/master

This will open up an editor with the commits of your feature branch and let you reorder, edit, and remove commits as you see fit.

If the main repository has been updated and you have fetched down those updates with `git fetch upstream` this will also move your feature branch so that it is based on the latest commit from the main repository.

If you have already pushed your feature branch to your fork a simple `git push origin my-feature-branch` will no longer work as the histories are different, instead you will have to run

    git push origin +my-feature-branch

The + sign signifies a force push and should be used with care.
If you have a pull request that has not yet been merged submitted for this feature branch this will update the pull request too.


### Resolving Merge Conflicts

The best way to resolve merge conflicts in feature braches is to rebase it on top of the updated upstream.
Run the following commands (substitute master with 1.2.x if your feature branch is based on that)

    git fetch upstream
    git rebase upstream/master

This will stop on the commit(s) that caused the merge conflict and let you resolve them manually before continuing.
Once you're done force push your updated feature branch with

    git push origin +my-feature-branch


### Updating Your GitHub Fork

No.
This is pointless busywork that accomplishes nothing.
Fetch the main repository directly as described above and base your feature branches on the refs from it.
GitHub has no interface or functionality for keeping the branches in your fork up to date with the branches in the main repository and there is no point in doing this for our feature branch based workflow.


## Changelog

There's a [Changelog](../CHANGELOG.md) in the root of the project.
If you make changes that are visible to users of this project you should add an entry to the changelog describing what has changed.
The format of this log should be self explanatory, please follow it carefully.


## Supported Node.js and Factorio Versions

Clusterio run on Node.js v12 and up, and v10 from v10.16.0, make sure to check that the Node builtin API's and npm packages you use are supported on these versions.
The Travis CI tests are runned on whatever version of Node.js v10 is the default, which at the time of writing is v10.18.0.

For Factorio Clusterio 2.0 aims to support version 0.17.69 and up, including the latest experimental release.
It's recommended that you use the lua API reference for 0.17.69, as there's no information on what version Factorio API's were introduced in.
The Travis CI tests are runned against latest experimental release.


## Code Style

The style of the code is a bit of a mixed bag at the moment.
But there are at least a few things that have been agreed upon.


### Naming style

JavaScript variables in general uses camelCase.
The exception is for classes/constructors which use PascalCase and variables destructured from over the wire objects.

Fields in configs and messages sent over links uses lowercase_underscore.

JavaScript files are named using lowercase_underscore for files that export multiple items.
Files containing and exporting a single class should be named the same as the class in PascalCase.

Imported modules from the lib package are prefixed with lib to make them easier to distinguish, as the names tend to be very generic.
E.g.:

    const libLink = require("@clusterio/lib/link");
    const libLuaTools = require("@clusterio/lib/lua_tools");


For lua code lowercase_underscore is used for everything.


### Strings

JavaScript and Lua code should use double quoted strings (`"string"`) for all strings with the only exception that strings that contain double quotes may use single quotes (i.e., `'String with "quotes"'`).
JavaScript template literals may also be used where appropriate.


### Indenting

JavaScript code should be indented with tabs.

Lua code should be indented with 4 spaces.


### Line Length

Lines are limited to 120 characters where tabs count as 4 characters.
If the argument list for a function or expressino for compound statement gets very long break them out on their own line(s).
For example:

    function foo(
        really, long, argument, list,
        over, multiple, lines
    ) {
        if (
            really && long && expression
            || over && multiple && lines
        ) {
            // code
        }
    })


### Markdown

Markdown files are formatted using one line per sentence to improve diff reports when making changes.
Headings have two spaces before them and on space after them to make them stand out, the heading at the top of the file does not have any spaces before it, and heading immediadly followed by another heading have one space between them.
For example:

```md
# A markdown File

Sentence of text which end in a period.
Each sentence is on it's own line.
And there's two spaces before the next heading.


## Subheading

### Sub-subheading

Headings use the `# heading` format.
```
